Welcome to my blog Journey!

`Single # to make it bigger`

# Welcome to my blog Journey!

`Double # to make it even bigger`

## Welcome to my blog Journey!

Here I will basicaly `show` how to make it prettier. 
Like `this` by only using ` before and after a word.

Or solo:

`HELLO WORLD!`

1. I can
2. use numbers
3. like this

I can also use code snippets:

`(Example in ruby, will make everything after in Java more likely)`

# Code Snippet:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

`This is done with: % highlight ruby % w/{}`

`And: % endhighlight % w/{} at the beginning/end.`

To test links, I will flex my [Twitch channel][twitch-channel].

`Link text used: [Twitch channel][twitch-channel]`

`On another line: [twitch-channel]: https://twitch.tv/clerici`

Get an idea on how I used jekyll to build this blog: [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs].
