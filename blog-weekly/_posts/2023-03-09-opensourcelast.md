## Welcome to my weekly post!

Working on open source projects has been a rollercoaster experience for me. At the beginning, I was blocked, didn't know where to start, but as the days passed by, I started to get involved. What helped me out is that Open source projects are an excellent way to get involved with communities of like-minded individuals, I have learned a lot about collaboration, communication and problem-solving. By working on a new issue, I have been able to contribute to important initiatives and develop new skills that will help me in the future.

One of the main insight I gained from working on open source is the importance of effective communication. When collaborating with others on a project, it is crucial to be clear and concise in your information or what you understand it's needed to ensure everyone is on the same page. I have also learned that being open to feedback and listening (reading) carefully is essential. By receiving feedback on my contributions, I have been able to improve and develop a better understanding of the project as a whole, and with Java, which I learned a new way to use ENUMS when there is already a way of working with certain values that are always the same. 

Even though last week was called challenges, I will talk about some of the ones I had in a less direct way. Starting from the inmense ammount of projects and people helping and looking where to take an Issue it can get hard to find one that you can put your hands on, at least when you are talking about a fresh project for you where you need to first go trough all the steps to make it run and then start with it, reading the code so you get familiar with it, find exactly where the bug is, implement your solution while being careful that you don't break anything else, such a party, but is the fun part of working on Open Source, how everyone is willing to give you a hand and explain if you have any trouble while implementing the solution to the issue.

As a refresher, I will also include the challenges I talked on my last post, but just the main ideas. 

* Code review and acceptance.
* Communication and collaboration.
* Community dynamics.
* Technical complexity.

Overall, working on open source projects has been a rewarding and educational experience that has helped me grow both personally and professionally. I encourage anyone who is interested in technology and learning how to write good code to consider getting involved in an open source project. It is an excellent way to learn and grow as a developer.
