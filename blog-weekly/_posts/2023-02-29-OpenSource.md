## Welcome to my weekly post!

Open-source software has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. Open-source software refers to computer programs that are made freely available to the public, along with the source code used to create them. This allows anyone to view and modify the code, and even distribute modified versions of the software. In this blog post, we will explore the benefits of open-source software, as well as some of the most popular open-source projects in use today.

There are several reasons why contributing to open source can be beneficial for both individuals and the broader community. Here are a few reasons why you might consider contributing to open source:

1. Skill development: Contributing to open source projects is a great way to develop your skills, as you'll have the opportunity to work on real-world projects with other experienced developers. By collaborating with others and tackling challenging problems, you can improve your coding skills, learn new programming languages and tools, and gain valuable experience working on complex projects.
2. Networking: Contributing to open source projects allows you to connect with other developers who share your interests and skills. By joining an open source community, you can build relationships with other contributors and potentially meet mentors or job opportunities in the field.
3. Portfolio building: Open source contributions can also be a great way to build your portfolio and demonstrate your skills to potential employers. When you contribute to an open source project, you're able to showcase your work to a large audience, which can help you stand out in a crowded job market.
4. Giving back to the community: Open source projects are often created to solve real-world problems and improve the lives of others.
5. Personal fulfillment: By working on projects that you're passionate about, you can feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in your work.

Overall, contributing to open source can provide numerous benefits for both individuals and the broader community. Whether you're looking to develop your skills, build your portfolio, or give back to the community, there are many benefits in Open-Source Software:

1. Cost-effective: One of the most significant benefits of open-source software is that it is typically free to use. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals or small businesses that may not have the budget for expensive proprietary software licenses.
2. Community-driven: Open-source software is often developed and maintained by a community of volunteers who are passionate about the project. This can lead to a more collaborative and innovative development process, with multiple contributors working together to improve the software.
3. Transparency: Because the source code is open and available to anyone, there is a greater level of transparency in the development process. This can help to build trust and credibility with users, who can see exactly how the software works and how it has been developed over time.

Open-source software has become an increasingly important part of the technology landscape, offering a range of benefits to users and developers alike. From cost savings to increased security and flexibility, open-source software is a powerful tool for anyone looking to build, manage, or use software in their daily lives. With so many great open-source projects available today, there has never been a better time to get involved in this exciting and innovative community.

For my first week on Open-Source, I decided to choose something easy to make my first Pull Request, I chose two projects, on called java design patterns and the other data structures and algorithms, the first one is about design patterns, which are formalized practices a programmer can use to solve problems when designing an app or system, they are often used to speed up
the development process because they provide tested, proven development paradigms. Data structures and algorithms, in the other hand, is oriented about creating multiple of them with
the goal of implementing data structures and algorithms to create an efficient and effective program that can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately.

I found an issue I can work with and made a pull request for both of them, I will explain them further in a technical log, which can be found on my blog.

Choosing an open source project can offer a range of benefits, both for individuals and organizations, that's why I decided to search for different repositories to find the one that fits for me,
in java, I really like Quarkus, which is a framework for writing java apps, and for my second stack I opted to work on Open Library, it provides access to many public domain and out-of-print books, which can be read online, this is in python.

I'm really excited to see what I can bring to the table on the more difficult challenges to come, because hether you are a developer, a user, or simply someone interested in technology, open source offers a world of opportunities and resources. By getting involved in open source projects, contributing to the community, and supporting open source initiatives, we can all play a role in shaping the future of technology and making it more accessible and inclusive for everyone!
