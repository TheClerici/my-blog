## Welcome to my 4th weekly post!

This week has been a real challenge, as a team, we needed to solve the code jam problems in different programming languages, which might not look hard at the beginning, but when you need to implement a new language, sometimes you need to make all over again as certain codes work different or don't have the same functions. 

Definitely hardest week so far, some challenges were harder than others, as the complexity was raising the further we got into them, but my oh my, being able to make them all work as Code Jam wants was intense. At the same time, making all the [Technical Logs][tech-logs] along the way and have them interesting and precise with the information was challenging. 

To understand Time and Space complexity I started a new [course][udemy-course] that helps with data structures and algorithms, this mainly so I can understand how to improve my coding so I can apply it in further coding. THis helped me with understandig that a good code is, and that it needs to be readable and scalable. Also how all the big O's work and how you can identify them. This was needed in a code challenge where I needed to make my code better because it was exceeding the time limit.

The Code Jam challenges where related to a coding competition that is _"Google's longest running coding competition, where programmers of all levels put their skills to the test. Competitors work their way through a series of online algorithmic puzzles to earn a spot at the World Finals, all for a chance to win the championship title and $15,000 USD."_ we were put to test on 2 categories of this 2022 Code Jam, `Qualification Round` and `Round 1A`, being a total of 8 challenges in 4 different programming languages, making them up to a total of 32 codes needed to implement in [Kotlin, Python, Dart and TypeScript], almost no one knew how to program on Dart and TypeScript, or even on Kotlin (as me), so we needed to team up and learn how to work together in order to complete them.

These challenges where hard, in the coding part and in the mathematical, because this were new coding for everyone and we need to learn basics of new languages and as people that are not used to resolving these kind of algorithms it can be quite difficult to come up with an answer, this being said, we meet up almost once a day to keep on track how much it's being achieved, the blockers and how we can help others to complete all the tasks given.

I also encountered myself with the problem of making my blog look better, as Github pages is new for me and I need to implement all of the knowledge I have been gaining, this is not hard to do but I certainly need to give it time and learn how to do it.

These past weeks have been moved, I'm really excited to see what is next on the line for us as apprentices, really certain that all the challenges that the team gives us are for the best and to push our limits, putting the work is always worth when you have the right approach. I learned a lot this week and I can't wait for the next ones.

Teamwork was key to fulfill this week assignments, without each one of us this past two weeks would've been impossible, really thankful to learn and be able to focus on my strengths and help others when needed. At the end we are searching for a common goal and it shows when we all are putting to effort to get it. Let's keep growing together and learning together!
