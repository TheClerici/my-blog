## Welcome to my weekly post!

I decided to call this week as challenges, because I learned a lot about how open source works when you are trying to make a commit that is more challenging for you, and needs you to know certain basics about the project you are working on. I will explain some of the ones I faced.

Code review and acceptance: While working on a PR, you need to bear in mind that you contribution needs to be secure, have compatibility and have the quality they are looking for, thats why it often envolves a review process that can be tedious but needed, it helps because you receive constant feedback, with these you get used to the standards and give more adecuate PRs on the future.

Communication and collaboration: Open source involves communication with a team of contributors, who may be located in different time zones and speak different languages (in my case, I'm currently communicating with a person that is in france and is helping me, so I make sure to put my doubts or make my draft before going to sleep so she can see it as soon as she wakes up). It helps to build an effective communication in a virtual environment with multiple people and multiple cultures.

Community dynamics: As a new contributor on any open source, it was challenging to addapt and understand all the norms and dynamic every community has, they are often competitive (as there is a lot of people willing to help so you have a hard time finding a project) or difficult to navigate (making your first step to a new project can be overwhelming). Even though, I have find all the communities to be really collaborative and supportive, which I love.

Technical complexity: Some projects are really technical and complex, and require a deep understanding of programming languajes, tools and frameworks. It can be a really good challenge to contribute for those who are still learning.

This week I mainly worked on meilisearch-java, what I liked is that the communication is fast and certain and you can get all your doubts solved for the next day, and something really cool was that it was getting more of a challenge as I already tried to commit twice but the person in charge asks me to add more things to it which is something that I like, because I get more involved in the project.

Open source is highly rewarding and beneficial, you gain valuable skills, build rellationships and contribute to different technologies, when you face a new challenge, you start taking the steps to address them. I found it as a really cool and accessible way for developers and users to participate in building something, helping shape the future.
