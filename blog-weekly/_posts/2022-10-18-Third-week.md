## Welcome to my 3rd weekly post!

First week that we have to work as a team, it was easier than I expected, as it seemed that the team
started everyone by themselves at the beginning, we just needed to reunite and after that everything 
started to flow. It was so nice how everyone was comfortable making the proposals and voting on what 
can be the best, really hope that we can finish, it looks like we will. 

As an individual, I focused on understanding all the problems, had some problems with the final two, 
in the meeting we discussed all of them and how they work, so after that I was able to understand them, 
it was just the technical part, which I need to work on next week, as I still find difficult to plasm 
all my ideas on the coding part, I know how to solve it, just not how to program it. 

Started with understanding dynamic programming, how it can be done by memoization or tabulating, but not really problem solving, for sure focusing 
on that, not only theory as practice makes perfect. I felt progression on my data structure but still I want to continue on it next week, 
see how much I can improve. 

It was fun to understand GitHub, not that I’m an expert already but it feels nice to learn a new app, how to make a new repo and work on it, 
how to work as a team in a repo and how to implement something in GitHub pages, using Git, which all of them are new things for me, 
hopefully I can move from the functional part and start making it pretty. 

For the group challenge I started with Kotlin, always fun to learn a new programming language, (we divided the tasks to make it easier, 
if there’s any question we can ask our teammates and I love that everyone is helping each other if needed) it was not that hard as it was 
more translating that anything, but it indeed worked so different than I expected, there is probably a better way to do it but and I will 
try to make it more functional for Kotlin, I learned that you need to think in that language as they work so differently from each other, 
they have their similarities but they are indeed not the same and you can really notice, logic also works differently, one has more 
restrictions while the other needs less structure, to make some examples. 

As a challenge, I decided to use Kotlin for the individual code jam challenge, I was able to finish it, All the troubles I had was on 
finding the right commands as they are different or work different in every language, also to implement the right answer, because in 
the beginning I tried something but it needed something extra, so adding that part was hard for me, at the end it worked well. 
I will explain further in my blog in the problem section. 

We also had a Sprint workshop with the UX team, it was fun to work along with client-employees of Encora as I think they have a complete mindset 
of what they do, not only a clue or a part of it or how we think that it is, in this Sprint, we worked together to make an app for the new members 
of encora, we worked brainstorm, on the categorization of it, a little interview (Which I ended up being part of it with another team, as 
I answered the questions), in this part I was able to see how the teams approached differently the aspects, as one team focused more on the feedback, 
my team was trying to implement an easy way to have all the tasks, meetings and employees in an app and not in separated websites or pages.  

Fun week, a lot of room of improvement, will focus on finishing all the work and make my blog not only functional but pretty and well distributed. 
I need to practice more in terms of structure and dynamic programming. On the Hyper skill part, I am 1 task away on finishing my first medium program, 
I will try to finish that next week and then I will not advance until we have the mentors. (Of course, being HS the last thing I do if 
I finish everything else.)
