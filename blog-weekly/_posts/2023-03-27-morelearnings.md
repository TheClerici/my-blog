## Welcome to my weekly post!

Welcome, readers! Thank you for taking the time to read this blog post. I appreciate your interest and hope you find information helpful. I wanted to let you know that this might be the last blog post for a while due to a new client project that requires my attention. However, we will continue to provide updates and content as soon as we are able to. In this blog post, we will be discussing several topics related to AWS cloud computing and JWT w/ Spring Boot.

We will start by exploring AWS S3 buckets, which are object storage solutions that allow you to store and retrieve large amounts of data. It provides a simple web service interface that allows you to access data from anywhere on the web. AWS S3 buckets are highly scalable, durable, and secure, making them an excellent choice for storing and managing data in the cloud.

Next, we will dive into AWS EC2 instances, which are virtual machines that provide compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 instances are highly customizable, allowing you to choose the operating system, instance type, and other configuration options that best fit your needs. EC2 instances can be used for a wide range of use cases, including web and mobile applications, big data analytics, and machine learning.

We will also discuss AWS auto-scaling, which is a feature that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to changes in demand. This allows you to ensure that you have enough compute capacity to handle your workload, while also minimizing costs and optimizing performance. It can also be used in conjunction with other AWS services, such as Elastic Load Balancing and CloudWatch, to create a highly scalable and reliable infrastructure.

Finally, we will talk about JWT auth with Spring Boot, JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. In a Spring Boot application, JWT can be used for authentication and authorization, allowing you to secure your application and protect sensitive data. JWT authentication involves verifying the identity of the user by validating their token, which is passed with each request. Once the token is validated, the user can access the protected resources in your application.

I hope this blog was informative, In the next blog post, we will dive deeper into AWS auto-scaling with SQS and SNS, as well as RabbitMQ for message queues. Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing more with you soon!
