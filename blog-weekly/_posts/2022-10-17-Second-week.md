## Welcome to my 2nd weekly post!

I’m starting to feel more confident around the team, guess everyone is as you can notice while we hang, really excited of what is heading 
next and what we can accomplish together.  

This week started with perception, every person perceives the world and approaches it differently, so it is important to be clear and work 
on how we say the things we want to communicate in a mature way to fully develop the message, and also apply it to ourselves to understand others, 
because the message can (or not) be understood depending on the perception of the receiver, we made a really cool activity that made this real clear, 
it was a crest and not every single one of us was able to detect it, even though all the things said were really creative and cool to interact with 
everyone. 

Always double tap, this meaning double check, in every aspect, if you have a doubt, ask again, no one will be mad. If you think the message was not 
clear, give it again, double tap it so everyone is on the same page. 

We got into a deeper conversation with the IT team, in this case was with Guillermo, where we got to know every member of the team and how they work, 
I might even ask further to see if there is some kind of availability as there is none of them on SLP which is somewhere I would like to live in the 
future, this as well as some characteristics we need to follow if we don’t work from a private network, the security standards that we need to follow.  

Going with perception, we actually also dig on Opportunity, how it is important to not slip on them, got a chance? Go for it! Do it! 
The only obstacle you have is yourself, so be willing to take the extra step and look for all the chances possible that you can have and squeeze them, 
so you can grow and learn and in that learning also help people grow, leave a mark as you walk through life, it changes everything! We all remember 
that one person that made a mark in our lives so wouldn’t it be nice to be that person for someone? 
 
If you can help Encora grow, do it. If you have the opportunity of someone joining the team, being a client or a teammate, do it. 
We can all learn from them and make this a better place for everyone. 
 
Hyper Skill shenanigans on 3 projects: Cinema Room Manager, Simple Chatty Bot, and Simple TicTacToe, I was able to finish 2 of them, 
being the last unfinished. I learned that you need to already have a direction when you are programming, trying to maintain a certain order 
when you start developing a simple task, because when you want to implement more and more, it starts feeling overwhelmed, and when that happens, 
you start losing track of what the program needs to do and it gets easier to get distracted. It was intense but fun, they included the basics, 
printing or scanning; If, while, for and switch; Arrays, strings and multi-dimensional arrays; Implementing methods and giving structure to the program. 
(Some examples here: Java Backend dev.docx just little ones as I like to go back every now and then to double check if what I write is well written). 

Liberate the musician within, it’s better to do things even if you are terrible at them than being afraid of doing, the fear of mistakes 
stunts creativity, take actions! Most problems are in our thoughts, don’t be scared of reaching success and allow mistakes to happen, connect with 
the flow as you live, let go of the feeling of control, have fun! This is way more important as you are working from space, which is the place you 
just let go of the judgmental thoughts and just enjoy and learn.  

Stop exploring, start acting. It is way easier to absorb and master smaller amounts of material, but if you keep exploring instead of trying things, 
you will get overwhelmed, you have yourself, use you! Take away the consequences and celebrate when you do something, even if it goes poorly. 

Search inside yourself, you can train emotional skills! Stay calm and clear on demand by being mindful, by doing this, you see things clearly, 
not only calm, but sharp (perceive your emotions, focus, start calming until they are gone), as you understand better what this means, 
you get to know yourself, what you are good or bad at, strengths or weaknesses. Find your deepest values and motivations to know what to pursue. 
By doing this you can catch the opportunities as you have deep knowledge of self, you start being physiological, not only existential. 
Remember that in life we are all humans, and just like me, they want to be happy and not suffer. 

In life, there is an extended list of failures, as in projects being personal or from work, even athletes or students experience it, 
what is important to understand is that failure is OK, what you must do is learn from them. 

We now get in the Zen mode, this mode when you feel in the zone, you get in the flow, you have effortless concentration and everything appears to be 
going as you want. This can be achieved by mastering the art of effortless concentration.  

It’s important to quiet the mind, let go of all of the judging processes we have when we are doing something as it only makes us add 
hings that are irrelevant and makes us start focusing on all the aspects of it instead of just doing it and then we start failing or just 
feeling we don’t do it good. We top getting the clearest possible image of the desired outcome. 

Learn how to learn, how to change a habit, because the harder you try to change it the harder it becomes to actually do it. 
Don’t assume you know, PRACTICE! If you start driving away, focus on bringing it gently back, so you can be the one who directs his own thinking, 
no past, no future... Present.
