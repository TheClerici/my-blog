Hello! I'm Enrique Clerici and welcome to my blog :)

I studied mechatronics engineer, currently learning how to become a fullstack developer.

Here I will track evertything I'm learning, in case I need to go back and refresh the memory, is always good to see where you are improving and where you need to put a little bit of more work. I'm Always trying to learn something new, 25 years old and ready to eat the world.

Feel free to get in contact through email, twitter or linkedIn, I don't bite!
