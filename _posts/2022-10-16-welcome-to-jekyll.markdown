# Welcome to my blog Journey!

Here I will basicaly `show` how to make it prettier. 
Like `this` by only using ` before and after a word.

Or solo and big:

`HELLO WORLD!`

I can also use code snippets:

`Example in ruby, will make everything after in Java more likely`

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

This is done with `"{% highlight ruby %}"` and `"{% endhighlight %}"` beginning/end.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs].
This is here only so you can get an idea on how I used jekyll to build this blog.

To test links, I will flex my [Twitch channel][twitch-channel].
