<h2>To Do App REACT / SPRING BOOT</h2>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<blockquote> <h3> General Overview: </h3> </blockquote> 

#### Functional requirements:

This was a project about an implementation of a to do list to help manage the tasks on a daily job, in order to achieve it, we were asked to follow a markup to design the app, it should include:

1. Search/Filtering Controls
2. New To Do Button. This should open a modal to type the “to do” data.
3. Priority column should show in the header the classic up and down arrows to allow the user to sort.
4. Due date column should show in the header the classic up and own arrows to allow the user to sort.
5. Action column to show actions (links/buttons) to allow the user to delete or edit a “to do”.
    * To Edit is ok to show a modal similar to the one to create a “to do”
6. Pagination control. Showing the pages, its number and the next and previous page is enough.
7. Area to show the metrics

For it, there were certain engineering requirements needed in order to implement the functionality of the app. Both front-end and back-end related. I will dive further into them later.

There will be no need to use a database by now, and we can store data in memory using Java Collections, it is also okay if data is lost when the app is shutdown. Some decisions were made based on that, because we were asked to design a persistent layer in which will be easy to switch from in-memory to database implementation.

<blockquote> <h3> BACKEND: </h3> </blockquote>

#### Backend Model:

A "to do" should have the following properties:

* Id. This could be a number or string or a combination. Must be unique.
* Text (required). Max length is 120 chars.
* A due date (optional).
* Done/undone flag.
* A done date. When the “to do” is marked as done this date is set.
* Priority (required). Options: High, Medium and Low.
* Creation date.
