# Double or One Thing

Here I will basicaly `show` how to make it prettier. 

1. I can
2. use numbers
3. like this

I can also use code snippets:

`(Example in ruby, will make everything after in Java more likely)`

# Code Snippet:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

To test links, I will flex my [Double or One Thing][cj-dor1].
