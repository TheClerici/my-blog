`Context`

## Qualification Round

# 1. Punched Cards

A secret team of programmers is plotting to disrupt the programming language landscape and bring punched cards back by introducing a new language called Punched Card Python that lets people code in Python using punched cards! Like good disrupters, they are going to launch a viral campaign to promote their new language before even having the design for a prototype. For the campaign, they want to draw punched cards of different sizes in ASCII art. 

The ASCII art of a punched card they want to draw is similar to an R×C matrix without the top-left cell. That means, it has `[(R⋅C) − 1]` cells in total. Each cell is drawn in ASCII art as a period `(.)` surrounded by dashes `(-)` above and below, pipes `(|)` to the left and right, and plus signs `(+)` for each corner. Adjacent cells share the common characters in the border. Periods `(.)` are used to align the cells in the top row.

# 2. 3D Printing

You were given three printers and will use each one to print one of the D's. All printers use ink from 4 individual cartridges of different colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) to form any color. For these printers, a color is uniquely defined by 4 non-negative integers c, m, y, and k, which indicate the number of ink units of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink (respectively) needed to make the color. 

The total amount of ink needed to print a single D is exactly 1 000 000 units. For example, printing a D in pure yellow would use 1 000 000 units of yellow ink and 0 from all others. Printing a D in the Code Jam red uses 0 units of cyan ink, 500000 units of magenta ink, 450000 units of yellow ink, and 50000 units of black ink.

# 3. d1000000

For this challenge, you will need to assume that the dices won’t have the typical 6 sides, and instead, consider the numbers of sides that will be given as an input. However, the dice will keep the property of being numbered from 1 to k. 

As parameters, you will be given T as number of cases, on the second line will be the list of N dice and on the following line will be list of the respective sides of the dice.  

On dice games like Yahtzee, a straight is a combination of a sequential consecutive cycle with the numbers from the dice. For example, getting all 1-2-3-4-5-6 on a traditional d6 dice.

# 4. Chain Reactions

Chain Reactions is a maximization challenge in which we are asked to "activate" N modules in a given order.  Each module has a fun factor F that lies between 1 and 10**9 and each module may point at one other module with a lower index. If not, it points at the abyss "0". The fun gotten from a chain reaction is the largest fun factor of all modules that triggered in that chain reaction. We are going to trigger each initiator module once, in some order. The overall fun from the session is the sum of the fun he gets from each chain reaction. Given the fun factors and the setup of the modules, compute the maximum fun we can get if we trigger the initiators in the best possible order.

# 5. Twisty Little Passages

You are investigating a cave, which is a simple undirected graph with N vertices and no isolated vertices. At the start you are told that the cave has `N <= 10^5` rooms. The vertex number you are at and the number of incident edges.  

When in a room, you can identify what room you are in and see how many passages it connects to, but you cannot distinguish the passages. You want to estimate the number of passages that exist in the cave. You are allowed to do up to `K = 8000` operations. An operation is either: 

Teleport: You choose to teleport to a vertex number of your choice 

Walk: You choose to be moved to a uniformly chosen random neighbor of the current vertex. 

After each move, you are told the vertex number and the number of incident edges. With this information you have to estimate the number of edges in the graph in an approximation error of 33.3%, and you are to succeed in at least 90% of the test cases.

## Round 1

# 1. Double or One Thing

You are given a string of uppercase English letters. You can highlight any number of the letters (possibly all or none of them). The highlighted letters do not need to be consecutive. Then, a new string is produced by processing the letters from left to right: non-highlighted letters are appended once to the new string, while highlighted letters are appended twice. 

Given a string, there are multiple strings that can be obtained as a result of this process, depending on the highlighting choices. Among all of those strings, output the one that appears first in alphabetical (also known as lexicographical) order. 

# 2. Equal Sum

You are given a set of distinct integers. You need to separate them into two non-empty subsets such that each element belongs to exactly one of them and the sum of all elements of each subset is the same. 

An anonymous tip told us that the problem above was unlikely to be solved in polynomial time (or something like that), so we decided to change it. Now you get to decide what half of the integers are! 

This is an interactive problem with three phases. In phase 1, you choose N distinct integers. In phase 2, you are given another N integers that are distinct from each other and from the ones you chose in phase 1. In phase 3, you have to partition those 2N integers into two subsets, both of which sum to the same amount. All 2N integers are to be between 11 and 109109, inclusive, and it is guaranteed that they sum up to an even number. 

_Binary Representation:_ It is a numbering system with base 2 in which numbers are represented using only two digits: zero and one (0 and 1). 

_Decimal to binary conversion:_ The number of the decimal system is divided by 2, whose whole result is divided again by 2, and so on until the dividend is less than the divisor, 2. Then the remainders are ordered starting from the last to the first, simply placed in reverse order as they appear in the division. This will be the number converted to binary.

# 3. Weightlifting

On this challenge you must count as an operation each time you whether put on or off weight to complete each exercise. As inputs you are given T number of cases on the first line, on the next line will be 2 integers with E number of exercises and W types of weights. Then, will follow E numbers of lines, with each one containing the weights required for each exercise. At the end of each line E of exercises you must empty the stack of weights.  

For example, if you have 3 exercises (e) with 1 weight type (w), and each of the exercises needs 1, 2 and 1 as weights, the result will be 4 operations. 

1. One operation to put on a 1w 
2. One operation to put another 1w to complete an exercise of 2w 
3. One operation to put off 1w and complete an exercise of 1w 
4. One operation to put off 1w and empty the stack

`Solution`

Before even starting to code, we decided that as a team we need to understand all the challenges, the first day was actually understanding them, everyone on their own, or at least try to understand the majority of them, the next day, on a teams call, we went 1 by 1 through all the challenges and explained them together, when there was no more questions the fun began, splitting (or co-programming) all the problems that we can, in order to reach the goal of finishing them all.

We started with the first 3 problems, and all the answer needed to be done by monday of the next week days. We reunited again with the news of 3 more new challenges, but we were on the same page, now we need 5 challenges again for the week and no more time to spare.

For the last 5 challenges, we made kind of the same thing, as some challenges were already written on the Individual part (as my case) we were a little bit ahead, so no time to waste, we divided again and in the following section of the technical log you will see how I aproached every challenge and how I helped to complete this CodeJam 2022 task!

## Round 1

# 1. Double or One Thing

This was casually a problem that I decided to make before knowing that we were going to do these 3 extra challenges, so I was able to help the team as I already had the solution for it. As I don't want to make this log any longer than it already is, I'm sharing a hyperlink to my [First Technical Log][first-log].
