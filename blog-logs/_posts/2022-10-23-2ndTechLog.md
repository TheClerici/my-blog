## Qualification Round

# 1 - Punched Cards

A secret team of programmers is plotting to disrupt the programming language landscape and bring punched cards back by introducing a new language called Punched Card Python that lets people code in Python using punched cards! Like good disrupters, they are going to launch a viral campaign to promote their new language before even having the design for a prototype. For the campaign, they want to draw punched cards of different sizes in ASCII art. 

The ASCII art of a punched card they want to draw is similar to an R×C matrix without the top-left cell. That means, it has [(R⋅C) − 1] cells in total. Each cell is drawn in ASCII art as a period (.) surrounded by dashes (-) above and below, pipes (|) to the left and right, and plus signs (+) for each corner. Adjacent cells share the common characters in the border. Periods (.) are used to align the cells in the top row.

# 2 - 3D Printing

You were given three printers and will use each one to print one of the D's. All printers use ink from 4 individual cartridges of different colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) to form any color. For these printers, a color is uniquely defined by 4 non-negative integers c, m, y, and k, which indicate the number of ink units of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink (respectively) needed to make the color. 

The total amount of ink needed to print a single D is exactly 1 000 000 units. For example, printing a D in pure yellow would use 1 000 000 units of yellow ink and 0 from all others. Printing a D in the Code Jam red uses 0 units of cyan ink, 500000 units of magenta ink, 450000 units of yellow ink, and 50000 units of black ink.

# 3 - d1000000

For this challenge, you will need to assume that the dices won’t have the typical 6 sides, and instead, consider the numbers of sides that will be given as an input. However, the dice will keep the property of being numbered from 1 to k. 

As parameters, you will be given T as number of cases, on the second line will be the list of N dice and on the following line will be list of the respective sides of the dice.  

On dice games like Yahtzee, a straight is a combination of a sequential consecutive cycle with the numbers from the dice. For example, getting all 1-2-3-4-5-6 on a traditional d6 dice.

# 4 -Chain Reactions

Chain Reactions is a maximization challenge in which we are asked to "activate" N modules in a given order.  Each module has a fun factor F that lies between 1 and 10**9 and each module may point at one other module with a lower index. If not, it points at the abyss "0". The fun gotten from a chain reaction is the largest fun factor of all modules that triggered in that chain reaction. We are going to trigger each initiator module once, in some order. The overall fun from the session is the sum of the fun he gets from each chain reaction. Given the fun factors and the setup of the modules, compute the maximum fun we can get if we trigger the initiators in the best possible order.

# 5 - Twisty Little Passages

You are investigating a cave, which is a simple undirected graph with N vertices and no isolated vertices. At the start you are told that the cave has N <= 10^5 rooms. The vertex number you are at and the number of incident edges.  

When in a room, you can identify what room you are in and see how many passages it connects to, but you cannot distinguish the passages. You want to estimate the number of passages that exist in the cave. You are allowed to do up to K = 8000 operations. An operation is either: 

Teleport: You choose to teleport to a vertex number of your choice 

Walk: You choose to be moved to a uniformly chosen random neighbor of the current vertex. 

After each move, you are told the vertex number and the number of incident edges. With this information you have to estimate the number of edges in the graph in an approximation error of 33.3%, and you are to succeed in at least 90% of the test cases.
